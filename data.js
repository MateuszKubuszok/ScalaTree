  Sometimes we do the opposite - we start by requiering some properties and methods and stating that if a value match the requirements it is our type.
  That's a structural typing.

  `A way of saying that if you represented one thing as a directed multigraph, and another things as a directed multigraph,
  then the former could be a subgraph of another, so you could always safely map relations in the former into relations in the latter.
  Requires that the relations "combine" that is, if there is some relation A -> B and B -> C in one graph, then there has to be a relation
  A -> C which can be assumed to be a combination of these two.
  <br><br>
  E.g. if your graph's nodes would be types and edges would be functions from one type into the other, a functor would provide a mapping from
  functions in one set into another: <code>List</code> functor would translate <code>Int => String</code> into <code>List[Int] => List[String]</code>.
  Usually, we convert the function and apply the value in one step with <code>fa.map(aToB)</code>.
  <br><br>
  If nodes represented types but edges represented subtyping relation, then functor would tell us that if there is subtyping relation between the types,
  then then the types created by passing these types into some parametric type have to be subtypes as well. Since functor is also known as <b>covariant
  functor</b>, this explains covariance in Scala: <code>List[X]</code> is covariant in <code>X</code> type parameter so if <code>A <: B</code> then <code>List[A] <: List[B]</code>.
  <br><br>
  Good intuition is treating such functors as producers. If you have a producer of values <code>A</code> then you can "append" function <code>A => B</code>
  to create a producer of <code>B</code>. Also if you have a producer of <code>B</code> and <code>A <: B</code> then producer can be safely upcasted to producer of <code>A</code>.`,

  <br><br>
  Good intuition is to treat such covariant functors as consumers. If you have a consumer of values <code>B</code> then you can "prepend" function <code>A => B</code>

  Functor is a producer where we can "append" function on the output. But this function is always takes 1 value and returns 1 value. We have no way of returning 0 or more than 1 values.
  However, if we have e.g. a <code>List</code> we could map it to another <code>List</code> - we could control how many elements will be produced from a single input value.
  Then, <code>flatten</code> would take care about merging <code>List</code>s together. Same principle applies to producers which aren't containers, but might model async or failable
  computations. By manually creating the producer out of value, we might decide to interupt the streak of successful computations. (Recovery would not be a part of the interface of monads).
  <br><br>
  Usually, we combine <code>map</code> and <code>flatten</code> into a single operation: <code>flatMap</code>. 
  <br><br>
  We require that for each monad has some "stupid" wrapping utility, which simply take a value a create a single-value producer out of it with no extra logic.
  This way <code>flatMap(wrap)</code> is a noop. We also want this producer's flattening be associative.
  <br><br>

  `Nice utility added in Scala 2.13 which help us chaining operations by appending functions.
  <br><br>
  Instead of <code>f(g(h(a)))</code> we could write <code>(f andThen g andThen h)(a)</code> to preserve visually the order of operations.
  However, if <code>a</code> as some result of chains of methods we would still have to make some effort to keep the order in our heads.
  <br><br>
  By importing <code>import scala.util.chaining._</code> we get another option: <code>a.pipe(f).pipe(g).pipe(h)</code>,
  so everything could be done with a single, consistent, easy to read chain.
  <br><br>
  Another useful method added this way is <code>.tap</code>. It executes the function, BUT it doesn't use its result and returns original value instead.
  It's a useful thing to avoid <code>expression.pipe { a => f(a); a }</code> which we could write if we wanted to use e.g. <code>println</code>
  or mutable operation returning <code>Unit</code>.`,
